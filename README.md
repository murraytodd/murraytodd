Hi, I’m @murraytodd. I've been writing code since (gulp) 1980, back when I could get my hands on
- My friend's Apple II+
- An HP 85 that another friend's Dad would occasinally bring home from work
- The uber-cool HP 9845C in my Dad's department's computer lab

My current passions center around Functional Programming and more specifically Scala and ZIO. I also
have a lot interest in analytical computing.
